Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It ensures the creation of reliable, efficient, and scalable software, supporting industries like healthcare, finance, and business.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Mastering complexity
- Mastering process
- Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
- requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
- design - building the framework. 
- coding - converting software design into tangible code.
- testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
- there is Low flexibility,
 changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Codes and maintains software.
- QA Engineer: Tests and ensures software quality.
- Project Manager: Manages timelines, resources, and coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): IDEs provide a comprehensive suite of tools that streamline the software development process. They include features like code editing, debugging, and project management in one interface. An example is visual studio code

- VCS are essential for tracking and managing changes in software projects, enabling collaboration and rollback functionality when necessary. An example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing requirements → Use Agile development.
- Complex debugging → Implement unit testing.
- Security threats → Follow security best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing: Tests individual components.
- Integration Testing: Ensures modules work together.
- System Testing: Verifies overall functionality.
- Acceptance Testing: Confirms user requirements are met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
   importance
- Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
- Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
- Improved Prompt: "Explain the impact of AI on healthcare, with examples of medical advancements."
- Why? The improved prompt is clearer , more specific and results in a focused AI response.
